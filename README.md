# HireMeBro

HireMeBro is a platform where companies can recruit employees based on their real professional achievements. Unlike traditional hiring platforms, HireMeBro leverages open-source data and coding contest results to validate candidate profiles, reducing the risk of fake resumes.

## Features

- **HireAI:** Automatically gathers and verifies candidate details from open sources and coding contests.
- **Hackathon Validator:** Sets new industry benchmarks by detecting false claims about hackathon participation.
- **Transparent Profiles:** Candidates are evaluated based on real, verifiable achievements.
- **Feedback Driven:** Open for user feedback to improve the platform.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up:** Candidates create a profile and link their coding contest accounts and open-source contributions.
2. **Verification:** HireAI collects and verifies data, building a trustworthy profile.
3. **Recruitment:** Companies search for candidates based on validated skills and achievements.
4. **Hackathon Validation:** Claims about hackathon participation are cross-checked for authenticity.
